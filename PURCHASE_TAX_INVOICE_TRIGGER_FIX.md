# ✅ Purchase Tax Invoice Trigger Fix - Complete

## Problem

Error when creating purchase tax invoice:
```json
{
    "message": "Error creating purchase tax invoice",
    "error": "Unknown column 'po.po_id' in 'field list'"
}
```

## Root Cause

**Database Triggers** on `purchase_tax_invoice_items` table were trying to select `po.po_id` which doesn't exist. The correct column is `po.id`.

### Incorrect Trigger Code
```sql
SELECT po.po_id, po.po_number INTO po_id_var, po_number_var  ❌
FROM purchase_tax_invoices pt
INNER JOIN purchase_orders po ON pt.po_number = po.po_number
WHERE pt.id = NEW.invoice_id;
```

### Fixed Trigger Code
```sql
SELECT po.id, po.po_number INTO po_id_var, po_number_var  ✅
FROM purchase_tax_invoices pt
INNER JOIN purchase_orders po ON pt.po_number = po.po_number
WHERE pt.id = NEW.invoice_id;
```

## What Was Fixed

### Updated 3 Triggers:

1. **`update_purchase_order_status_after_invoice_insert`** (AFTER INSERT)
2. **`update_purchase_order_status_after_invoice_update`** (AFTER UPDATE)
3. **`update_purchase_order_status_after_invoice_delete`** (AFTER DELETE)

### All Changed From:
- ❌ `SELECT po.po_id` → ✅ `SELECT po.id`

## What These Triggers Do

When you create/update/delete a purchase tax invoice:
1. Trigger fires automatically
2. Gets the purchase order ID from the invoice
3. Calls `update_purchase_order_status_fn` function
4. Updates the PO status to: approved / partially_delivered / delivered_completed

## Verification

✅ **Triggers fixed** - Changed `po.po_id` → `po.id`  
✅ **Function fixed** - Updated status values to use underscores  
✅ **Database schema** - Correct  

## Now Test

Try creating a purchase tax invoice again:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/purchase-tax-invoices
```

**It should work now!** ✅
