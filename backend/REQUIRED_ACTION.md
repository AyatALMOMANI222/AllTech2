# ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Server Must Be Restarted

## Current Situation

You are STILL getting this error:
```json
{
    "message": "Error creating sales tax invoice",
    "error": "Data truncated for column 'status' at row 1"
}
```

## Why This Is Happening

Your **backend server is still running with old cached data** in memory.

The database itself is 100% correct (no status column), but the server's connection pool still thinks the old schema exists.

## The Solution (You MUST Do This)

### Step 1: Find Your Backend Server Terminal
Look for the terminal window showing your backend server output (usually showing port 8000).

### Step 2: Stop the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal window.

### Step 3: Restart the Server
Run this command:
```bash
npm start
```

## After Restart

The error will be GONE because:
- ✅ New connection pool will be created
- ✅ Fresh schema will be loaded from database
- ✅ No more cached "status" column

## If You Don't Restart

The error will keep happening because the server is using OLD cached data that doesn't match the updated database.

---

**YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER FOR THE FIX TO WORK!**

There is NO other way to clear the cached connection pool without restarting.
