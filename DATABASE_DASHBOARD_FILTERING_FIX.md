# Database Dashboard Filtering Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved

The Database Dashboard was displaying purchase order data without properly filtering between Supplier and Customer orders. The system now correctly displays:

- **SUPPLIER section**: Only shows supplier purchase orders (order_type = 'supplier')
- **CUSTOMER section**: Only shows customer purchase orders (order_type = 'customer')

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Frontend: `frontend/src/components/DatabaseDashboard/index.js`

#### 1. SUPPLIER Section (Lines 363-412)
**Before:** Showed any purchase order data (could be mixed supplier/customer)
**After:** Properly filters for supplier orders only

```javascript
const supplierApproved = item.purchase_orders?.approved_orders?.find(o => o.order_type === 'supplier');
const supplierDelivered = item.purchase_orders?.delivered_orders?.find(o => o.order_type === 'supplier');
```

Shows:
- APPROVED PURCHASE ORDER data from supplier orders
- DELIVERED PURCHASE ORDER data from supplier orders with delivered fields:
  - Delivered Quantity
  - Delivered Unit Price
  - Delivered Total Price
  - Penalty %
  - Penalty Amount
  - Invoice No
  - Balance Quantity Undelivered
  - Supplier Name

#### 2. CUSTOMER Section (Lines 415-464)
**Before:** Showed data without proper filtering
**After:** Properly filters for customer orders only

```javascript
const customerApproved = item.purchase_orders?.approved_orders?.find(o => o.order_type === 'customer');
const customerDelivered = item.purchase_orders?.delivered_orders?.find(o => o.order_type === 'customer');
```

Shows:
- APPROVED SALES ORDER data from customer orders
- DELIVERED SALES ORDER data from customer orders with delivered fields:
  - Delivered Quantity
  - Delivered Unit Price
  - Delivered Total Price
  - Penalty %
  - Penalty Amount
  - Invoice No
  - Balance Quantity Undelivered
  - Customer Name

## 📊 Display Logic

The dashboard now properly separates data:

| Section | Shows | Filter |
|---------|-------|--------|
| SUPPLIER - Approved | Supplier PO data | `order_type === 'supplier'` |
| SUPPLIER - Delivered | Supplier delivered data | `order_type === 'supplier'` + status = delivered |
| CUSTOMER - Approved | Customer PO data | `order_type === 'customer'` |
| CUSTOMER - Delivered | Customer delivered data | `order_type === 'customer'` + status = delivered |

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Clear Data Separation** - Supplier and Customer data no longer mixed
2. **Accurate Display** - Each section shows only relevant data
3. **Delivered Data Visible** - All calculated delivered values display correctly:
   - Delivered quantities from invoices
   - Unit prices from invoices
   - Total prices (quantity × unit_price)
   - Penalty amounts (calculated)
   - Balance quantities (ordered - delivered)
4. **Better User Experience** - Users can easily see supplier vs customer data

## ✨ Automatic Recalculation Integration

The dashboard now properly displays all the automatically calculated data from the backend:

1. **When invoices are created/updated/deleted**
   - Backend calculates delivered quantities
   - Backend sums quantities across all invoices
   - Backend calculates penalties and balances
2. **Dashboard displays the results**
   - Shows supplier orders in SUPPLIER section
   - Shows customer orders in CUSTOMER section
   - All delivered values come from pre-calculated database fields

## 📝 Data Flow

```
1. User creates Purchase Tax Invoice (Supplier PO)
   ↓
2. Backend calculates:
   - delivered_quantity from all invoices
   - delivered_unit_price from invoices
   - delivered_total_price (calculated)
   - penalty_amount (calculated)
   - balance_quantity_undelivered (calculated)
   ↓
3. Updates purchase_order_items table
   ↓
4. Dashboard queries database
   ↓
5. Filters for order_type = 'supplier'
   ↓
6. Displays in SUPPLIER DELIVERED section ✅
```

Same flow for Customer orders, but uses Sales Tax Invoices.

## 🎉 Result

The Database Dashboard now:
- ✅ Shows supplier data in the SUPPLIER section
- ✅ Shows customer data in the CUSTOMER section
- ✅ Displays all calculated delivered values
- ✅ Separates approved and delivered data properly
- ✅ Works with automatic recalculation system

**The implementation is complete and ready to use!** 🚀
