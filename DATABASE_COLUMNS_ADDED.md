# Database Columns Added to purchase_order_items Table

## Summary
Added the missing `delivered_quantity`, `delivered_unit_price`, and `delivered_total_price` columns to the `purchase_order_items` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Database Schema (`backend/initDb.js`)
Added three new columns to the `purchase_order_items` table schema:
```sql
delivered_quantity DECIMAL(10,2),
delivered_unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
delivered_total_price DECIMAL(12,2),
```

**Column Details:**
- `delivered_quantity` - Decimal field for the quantity that was actually delivered
- `delivered_unit_price` - Decimal field for the unit price of delivered items
- `delivered_total_price` - Decimal field for the total price of delivered items (quantity × unit_price)

All columns are nullable and have no default values.

### 2. Created Migration Script (`backend/migrations/add_delivered_fields_to_po_items.js`)
Created a migration script that:
- Checks if the columns already exist before adding them
- Safely adds columns to existing databases
- Uses the same database configuration as `server.js`
- Provides clear feedback about what operations were performed

### 3. Executed Migration
The migration was executed and confirmed that:
- ✅ All three columns already existed in the database
- ✅ No errors occurred
- ✅ Database structure is now consistent with the schema

## Column Positions
The new columns are positioned after `balance_quantity_undelivered` and before `comments`:
```sql
...
balance_quantity_undelivered DECIMAL(10,2),
delivered_quantity DECIMAL(10,2),
delivered_unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
delivered_total_price DECIMAL(12,2),
comments TEXT,
...
```

## Usage
These columns are now available in the backend API and can be used to:
1. Track actual delivered quantities vs ordered quantities
2. Calculate delivered totals (quantity × unit_price)
3. Store delivered unit prices independently from ordered prices
4. Support invoice generation and delivery tracking

## Database Configuration
The migration uses the same database configuration as the main application:
- **Host:** 127.0.0.1
- **Port:** 3306
- **Database:** management
- **User:** root
- **Password:** (from environment or default)

## Status
✅ **Completed** - All required columns exist in the database and the schema is updated.
